The few war chiefs whose deeds live up to their ambitions soon find themselves leading an arm of the Ravagers—and honored by the title of Slaughter Lord. A Slaughter Lord craves combat like it craves food, and leads Ravager raids as often as possible, but is frequently forced to remain at its stronghold because of its strict regimen of alchemical treatments.\n A small army of shamans and alchemists attend to the Slaughter Lords in order to artificially enhance their already-tremendous strength. The blessings and concoctions crafted by the orc-lords’ lackeys grow their muscular forms to mountainous size, sharpen their tactical reasoning, and bestow upon them the divine protection of the One-Eyed Ruiner. While their unnatural size is a Slaughter Lord’s most obvious martial advantage—it dual-wields weapons most humans could only wield with two hands—the Ruiner’s blessings grant it tremendous divine magic.

      :description
      "Beginning at 1st level, you have survived the Hunter’s Bane, a dangerous, long-guarded ritual that alters your life’s blood, forever binding you to the darkness and honing your senses against it. You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track fey, fiends, or undead, as well as on Intelligence ability checks to recall information about them.\n   The Hunter’s Bane also empowers your body to control and shape hemocraft magic, using your own blood and life essence to fuel your abilities. Some of your features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:\n\nHemocraft save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier."}

      "At 1st level, you gain the ability to channel, and sometimes sacrifice, a part of your vital essence to curse and manipulate creatures through hemocraft magic. You gain one blood curse of your choice, detailed in the “Blood Curses” section at the end of the class description. You learn one additional blood curse of your choice, and you can choose one of the blood curses you know and replace it with another blood curse, at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.\n   When you use your Blood Maledict, you choose which curse to invoke. While invoking a blood curse, but before it affects the target, you can choose to amplify the curse by losing a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. An amplified curse gains an additional effect, noted in the curse’s description. Creatures that do not have blood in their bodies are immune to blood curses, unless you have amplified the curse.\n   You can use this feature once. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Blood Maledict feature twice, at 13th level you can use it three times between rests, and at 17th level, you can use it four times between rests. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\n\nLevel      Hemocraft Die\n 1st                 1d4\n 2nd                1d4\n 3rd                1d4\n 4th                1d4\n 5th                1d6\n 6th                1d6\n 7th                1d6\n 8th                1d6\n 9th                1d6\n10th               1d6\n11th               1d8\n12th               1d8\n13th               1d8\n14th               1d8\n15th               1d8\n16th               1d8\n17th              1d10\n18th              1d10\n19th              1d10\n20th              1d10",

You learn two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn an additional warlock cantrip of your choice at 10th level.\n   Spell Slots. The Profane Soul Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level.

You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.\n   For example, when you are 8th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots.

A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 11th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.\n   Additionally, when you gain a level in this class and order, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n   Spellcasting Ability.

While you have an active Crimson Rite, you can use your weapon as a spellcasting focus (found in chapter 5 of the Player’s Handbook) for your warlock spells, and you gain a specific benefit based on your chosen pact (outlined below).\n   The Celestial. You can expend a use of your Blood Maledict feature as a bonus action to heal one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you.
